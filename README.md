# PyBer-Analysis
Data Analysis &amp; Visualization for Ride-Sharing Company

## Overview of Ride-Sharing Analysis
PyBer, a python based ridesharing app, has asked that we conduct analyses on their ride sharng services to uncover trends and deliver comprehensive reports on which cities have the most rides, the most drivers, and the highest fares.


## Results
Through our analyses we have come to discover that Urban areas have the most PyBer activity and app usage, the most total rides, the most total drivers and the highest total ride fares. Urban areas actually outclass the other two city types (Suburban & Rural) by a wide, significant margin. Second highest in these metrics is the Suburban city type, then the lowest in these metrics is the Rural city type. Where things differ statistically, however, are the average fares per ride and driver based on city types. To understand the analysis consider the following statistical results

            Total Rides    Total Drivers     Total Fares     Avg Fare per Ride   Avg Fare per Driver
Rural:        125               78              $4,327.93         $34.62               $55.49
Suburban:     625               490             $19,356.33        $30.97               $39.50  
Urban:        1625              2405            $39,854.38        $24.53               $16.57


Dispite Urban areas having the most app usage, highest total fares, most total rides and most total drivers, the average fare per ride and per driver is significantly lower than for both Suburban and for Rural city types. In fact, the relationship between the first three statistical measures and the last two are inversely proportional across the three city types.

## Summary
Our statistical analyses lead us to believe that despite the high app usage, ride & driver volume, and high total fares of Urban cities, one particular factor can be attributed to why the average fares per ride and driver are so low. Similarly, this one factor can explain why Rural and Subruban cities, despite their average to low app usage, ride & driver volume, and total fares, have such high average fares per ride and driver.

That particular factor is ride distance / length of ride.

Urban cities have the most people in them, similarly most urban cities are microchosms with everything needed for citizens to live, thrive, and explore within it. As such the distances that ride-share users would need to go when hailing a ride would be considerably shorter, especially compared to Rural and Suburban cities.

Take New York City for example, if you wanted to hail a taxi or ride-sharing car to get to the movie theater, the car would probably pick you up and drop you off 3-8 blocks away! Conversely, in rural cities, in order to get to the closest supermarket from your home, you may have to travel tens of miles! As a result fares are much higher on average due to distance in Rural and Suburban cities even though they have much fewer PyBer riders and drivers.

## Conclusion
This analysis was a testament to correlational factor deduction. The story of the data may not make sense without an evaluation of outside factors that contribute to how PyBer (or whatever firm is being analyzed) prices its rates and fares. Despite Rural cities having fewer riders and drivers (most likely due to their relatively lower population compared to Suburban and Urban cities), the cost of a ride is significantly higher than it would be in Urban and Suburban cities for example, because rural citizens have to travel much farther to get to their destinations, as compared to urban citizens whose destinations are considerably closer in proximity to them. This explains why as we go from rural to urban cities, number of riders, number of drivers, and total fares increases significantly while average fares per ride and per driver decrease considerably.
